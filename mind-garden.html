        <!-- Overview -->
        <section class="project-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Description</h2>
          <p>Mind Garden is a kinetic sculpture installation that materializes invisible cognitive processes through choreographed mechanical motion. Exhibited at Waterloo Region Museum in November 2024, the piece transforms abstract neuroscience concepts—memory consolidation, creative insight, emotional regulation—into tangible, observable phenomena through a field of motorized mechanical flowers.</p>

          <p>Each flower embodies a specific aspect of mental experience, executing unique motion patterns derived from computational models of neural dynamics. The installation invites viewers to contemplate the mechanistic underpinnings of consciousness while simultaneously experiencing the emergent beauty that arises from complex systems.</p>

        <!-- Conceptual Framework -->
        <section class="project-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Conceptual Framework</h2>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Cognitive Neuroscience as Metaphor</h3>
          <p>Mind Garden draws inspiration from contemporary research in cognitive neuroscience and dynamical systems theory of mind. Each flower represents a discrete cognitive module with characteristic temporal dynamics:</p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Memory Flower (Blue)</strong>: Slow oscillations (0.1-0.3 Hz) mimicking hippocampal theta rhythms during memory encoding. Petals unfurl gradually then rapidly close, analogous to long-term potentiation followed by consolidation.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention Flower (Red)</strong>: Rapid, stochastic movements representing attentional saccades and focus shifting. Motion driven by Poisson process (λ = 2 events/second) with brief periods of sustained stillness (sustained attention).</li>
            <li><strong>Emotion Flower (Yellow)</strong>: Biphasic motion cycling between expansion (positive valence) and contraction (negative valence), modeled after bipolar affective oscillations with period ~15 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity Flower (Purple)</strong>: Chaotic trajectories interspersed with sudden coordinated movements, representing exploratory ideation punctuated by moments of insight (aha moments). Implemented via Lorenz attractor-driven servo trajectories.</li>
            <li><strong>Decision Flower (Green)</strong>: Binary open/closed states with probabilistic transitions, visualizing drift-diffusion decision-making models. Transition probability modulated by accumulated evidence variable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Systems-Level Emergence</h3>
          <p>While each flower operates according to independent algorithms, collective dynamics exhibit emergent synchronization phenomena reminiscent of neural assemblies:</p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Spontaneous Clustering</strong>: Flowers occasionally phase-lock into coordinated group motion despite lacking explicit inter-flower communication</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Dynamics</strong>: System exhibits avalanche-like cascades where one flower's motion triggers neighboring responses, analogous to neuronal criticality</li>
            <li><strong>Attractor States</strong>: Garden converges to recurring global configurations (all open, all closed, checkerboard patterns) representing cognitive "modes"</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These emergent properties were not explicitly programmed but arise naturally from the coupled dynamics, serving as metaphor for how consciousness emerges from unconscious neural mechanisms.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Technical Implementation -->
        <section class="project-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Technical Implementation</h2>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Mechanical Design</h3>
          <p>Each flower consists of a 4-petal compliant mechanism actuated by a single servo motor:</p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Petal Linkage</strong>: Four-bar linkage with flexure hinges (laser-cut 3mm acrylic) converts rotational servo motion into radial petal opening/closing</li>
            <li><strong>Actuation</strong>: MG996R servo (180° range, 11 kg-cm torque) drives central cam mechanism that symmetrically actuates all four petals</li>
            <li><strong>Materials</strong>: Petals fabricated from translucent acrylic (3mm thickness) with embedded RGB LED strips for chromatic expression synchronized to motion state</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Base</strong>: 3D-printed PLA stem (20cm height) houses wiring and provides mounting interface to base platform</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Control Architecture</h3>
          <p>Distributed embedded control system with centralized coordination:</p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Local Controllers</strong>: Each flower has dedicated Arduino Nano executing independent motion algorithm. Onboard 10-bit DAC generates analog servo control signals.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Orchestrator</strong>: Raspberry Pi 4 runs master timing system and broadcasts synchronization signals via I2C bus (100 kHz clock). Also handles audio playback for ambient soundscape.</li>
            <li><strong>Motion Algorithms</strong>: Implemented as finite state machines with stochastic transition probabilities. Servo trajectories generated via quintic polynomial interpolation for smooth, organic motion profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>LED Control</strong>: WS2812B addressable RGB LEDs (60 LEDs/meter) controlled via FastLED library. Color and brightness modulated based on current petal position and velocity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Power Distribution</h3>
          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Main Supply</strong>: 5V/40A switching power supply (200W rated capacity) with centralized distribution to all flowers</li>
            <li><strong>Per-Flower Budget</strong>: Each flower draws 5-8W peak (servo + LEDs), total installation power consumption ~80W steady-state</li>
            <li><strong>Voltage Regulation</strong>: Local LDO regulators (LM1117-3.3) for Arduino logic supply, separate 5V rail for servos to isolate switching noise</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Motion Programming -->
        <section class="project-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Motion Programming & Choreography</h2>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Trajectory Generation</h3>
          <p>Servo motion profiles designed to evoke organic, lifelike quality rather than robotic precision:</p>

          <p><strong>Sinusoidal Basis Functions</strong>: Position trajectories composed as weighted sums of sine waves with incommensurate periods to avoid exact repetition:</p>

          <p class="equation">θ(t) = A₁·sin(ω₁·t + φ₁) + A₂·sin(ω₂·t + φ₂) + A₃·sin(ω₃·t + φ₃)</p>

          <p>where amplitudes {A_i}, frequencies {ω_i}, and phases {φ_i} are tuned per flower type to achieve characteristic motion signatures.</p>

          <p><strong>Noise Injection</strong>: Low-amplitude Perlin noise (amplitude ±5°) added to trajectories to simulate natural variability and prevent mechanical predictability</p>

          <p><strong>Velocity Smoothing</strong>: S-curve acceleration profiles (7-segment polynomial interpolation) eliminate jerk at motion initiation/termination, critical for preventing vibration transmission to neighboring flowers</p>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Emergent Interaction Modes</h3>
          <p>While flowers nominally operate independently, weak coupling arises through several mechanisms:</p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Mechanical Coupling</strong>: Vibrations transmitted through shared base platform create subtle phase-locking between adjacent flowers</li>
            <li><strong>Light Cross-Talk</strong>: LED illumination from neighboring flowers detected by onboard photoresistors, feeding into stochastic decision algorithms</li>
            <li><strong>Programmed Responsiveness</strong>: 10% probability per timestep that a flower will mirror the motion state of nearest neighbor, creating avalanche propagation effects</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
