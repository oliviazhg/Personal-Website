        <section class="project-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Description</h2>
          <p>PRISM Collective is a creative technology community I co-founded at the University of Waterloo to bridge the gap between technical research and experiential public art. We are a multidisciplinary group of engineers, artists, designers, and researchers building interactive installations, kinetic sculptures, and immersive experiences that make emerging technologies tangible and accessible.</p>

          <p>In under 6 months, PRISM has grown to become Waterloo's largest creative tech collective, with 120+ active members collaborating on projects spanning robotics, generative art, spatial computing, biosignals, and experimental human-computer interaction. We've exhibited work at museums, public spaces, and academic symposia, reaching audiences of over 2000+ people.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Mission & Philosophy</h2>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Bridging Research and Public Engagement</h3>
          <p>Academic research often remains confined to conference proceedings and laboratory prototypes, inaccessible to broader audiences. PRISM serves as a translation layer, transforming technical concepts into visceral experiences that provoke curiosity, wonder, and critical dialogue about technology's role in society.</p>

          <p><strong>Core principles</strong>:</p>
          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Research-Driven Creation</strong>: Projects grounded in emerging scientific and engineering research (e.g., affective computing, soft robotics, spatial audio)</li>
            <li><strong>Public Accessibility</strong>: Prioritize experiential learning over technical jargon; design for diverse audiences including children, non-technical adults, and domain experts</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental Courage</strong>: Embrace technical and aesthetic risk; value novel failures over incremental successes</li>
            <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration</strong>: Actively recruit outside traditional engineering/CS domains (fine arts, music, philosophy, social sciences)</li>
            <li><strong>Open Knowledge Sharing</strong>: Document processes, release open-source code/CAD, and mentor newcomers through workshops</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="subsection-title">Community Structure</h3>
          <p>PRISM operates as a non-hierarchical collective with distributed leadership:</p>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Project Teams</strong>: Self-organizing groups of 3-8 members working on specific installations (e.g., kinetic sculpture team, VR experience team)</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Shares</strong>: Weekly technical workshops led by members on topics like TouchDesigner, Arduino, 3D printing, laser cutting, generative AI</li>
            <li><strong>Work Sessions</strong>: Bi-weekly open studio nights in campus makerspace for collaborative building and peer feedback</li>
            <li><strong>Community Events</strong>: Monthly public exhibitions, artist talks, and interdisciplinary symposia open to broader Waterloo community</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
